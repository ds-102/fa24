Hi! I'm Sandya, an IEOR Masters student from Indonesia. In my free time I love to read & explore new places in search of hidden food spots, nature, and niche shops. I'm passionate about the intersection of tech & climate, and Data 102 has played a pivotal role in me navigating my path -- I hope this class will leave a positive impact on you too :D
